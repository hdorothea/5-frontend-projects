# 5 Frontend Projects

The purpose of this [projects](https://hdorothea.github.io/5-frontend-projects/) is to learn web development with HTML, CSS and JavaScript (no frameworks, no jQuerry) without being bogged down by the architectural concerns of a full-stack app. Inspired by [25 React Projects](http://sean-smith.me/assets/portfolio/25-react-projects/index.html)

I am not exactly sure yet which projects I am going to implement. Some ideas are:

* To-do list
* Twitter suggestion box
* Autocomplete element with images ala facebook/twitter
* carousel with images ala netflix/airbnb
* tic-tac-toe
* infinite scroll ala twitter/facebook 
* drawing board

## The challenge

1. Do not spend more than a day per project. 
2. Add one technology/tool you are not very comfortable with per project. I.e for me:

* Project 1: never ever type console.log for debugging use developer tools
* Project 2: unit test using chai, moccha and karma
* Project 3: use sass

etc.
